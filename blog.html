                    1) what is the difference between local storage and session storage ?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    ANS:-
                    localStorage and sessionStorage are both ways for browsers to store key/value pairs for a particular
                    domain using the Web Storage API.
                    <br>
                    In this article, we will take a look at the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage and
                    learn how to use them.
                    <br>
                    “The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or
                    local storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data
                    items.”
                    <br>

                    localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                    <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                    <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
                <br>
                localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new
                tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
                <br>
                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and
                new storage.

                    2) what is the difference between Global Scope and Block Scope ?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    AND:-
                    <strong>Global Scope :</strong>
                    Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global Scope
                    <br>
                    Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a JavaScript program.
                    <br>
                    Variables declared with var, let and const are quite similar when declared outside a block.
                    <br>
                    They all have Global Scope:
                    <br>
                    var x = 2; // Global scope
                    <br>
                    let x = 2; // Global scope
                    <br>
                    const x = 2; // Global scope
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Block Scope:</strong>
                    Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
                    <br>

                    ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
                    <br>
                    These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Example
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    {
                    <br>
                    let x = 2;
                    <br>
                    }
                    // x can NOT be used here
                    <br>
                    Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
                    <br>
                    Variables declared inside a { } block can be accessed from outside
                    <br>
                    the block.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Example
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    {<br>

                    3) How does the event loop work in Javascript?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <br>
                    ANS:- The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming. JS executes all
                    operations on a single thread, but using a few smart data structures, it gives us the illusion of
                    multi-threading. Let’s take a look at what happens on the back-end.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The call stack is responsible for keeping track of all the operations in line to be executed.
                    Whenever a function is finished, it is popped from the stack.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The event queue is responsible for sending new functions to the stack for processing. It follows the
                    queue data structure to maintain the correct sequence in which all operations should be sent for
                    execution.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Whenever an async function is called, it is sent to a browser API. These are APIs built into the
                    browser. Based on the command received from the call stack, the API starts its own single-threaded
                    operation.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    An example of this is the setTimeout method. When a setTimeout operation is processed in the stack,
                    it is sent to the corresponding API which waits till the specified time to send this operation back
                    in for processing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Where does it send the operation? The event queue. Hence, we have a cyclic system for running async
                    operations in JavaScript. The language itself is single-threaded, but the browser APIs act as
                    separate threads.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The event loop facilitates this process; it constantly checks whether or not the call stack is
                    empty. If it is empty, new functions are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current
                    function call is processed.
                    <br>
