                    1) what is the difference between local storage and session storage ?
                </h3>

                    ANS:-
                    localStorage and sessionStorage are both ways for browsers to store key/value pairs for a particular
                    domain using the Web Storage API.
                    <br>
                    In this article, we will take a look at the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage and
                    learn how to use them.
                    <br>
                    “The Storage interface of the Web Storage API provides access to a particular domain's session or
                    local storage. It allows, for example, the addition, modification, or deletion of stored data
                    items.”
                    <br>

                    localStorage and sessionStorage are almost the same. Both have the following rules:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>They store key/value pairs for a particular domain.</li>
                    <li>The values stored may only be strings.</li>
                    <li>They have a limit of around 5MB of storage space.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                The one major difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is the expiration date.
                <br>
                localStorage persists the storage across browser sessions. So even if the domain is opened in a new
                tab, or the browser is closed and reopened, the storage is saved. There is no expiration.
                <br>
                sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. A page session lasts as long as the tab or the
                browser is open. Therefore, when you open a new tab or a new window, this creates a new session and
                new storage.
